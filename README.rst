The Django Book
===============

Welcome to the community edition of the Django Book!

This book was originally published by Apress in 2009 and covered Django version 1.0. Since then it has languished and, in places, is **extremely out of date**. We are working on getting the book updated to cover Django versions 1.4, 1.5, and beyond. But we need your help, we’re making this book — warts and all — open source in the hopes that it will find love as a community project.

So, if you'd like to help out, send us a pull request!
